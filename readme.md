# UX



## About the business - 
The Pilates Parlour is a new Pilates studio in the south west region of Ireland. Brainchild of inspirational Pilates master instructors, Ursula and Hanna Gluckman. The custom-built studio opened its doors in 2016 in Ennis, Co Clare. 

The studio, in the past, catered for small groups of students but recently has built on three further rooms and hired another instructor. Their methods and classes have delivered amazing results in alleviating backpain and poor posture, while improving flexibility, fitness and overall health. Bodies get transformed. 
Once attended, users return to The Pilates Parlour again and again.

## Project Goals for the business -
We plan to build an impressive website in order to create a strong online presence and promote the existing “The Pilates Parlour” business in the south west region of Ireland and beyond.
The website will provide the following information in a positive user-focused manner:
*	Use suitable typograph, imagery and color schemes across all pages to provide a positive experience for our users.

*	Tell the background story of The Pilates Parlour, its ethos and the history behind the effective Pilates method used.

*	Provide an insight into the instructors and their qualifications

*	Provide a brief but informative description of the classes and the different levels of fitness and flexibility catered for

*	Provide the class schedules

*	List clearly the cost involved 

*	Explain what one needs to bring with them to the classes and what to expect?

*	Provide location and contact details, including a contact form so that users and send in their details and thus we can contact them directly and sign them up to the most suitable class for them.

*	Ultimately – the site will promote the business and increase sunscribers and revenue.

	
_Once the business has established a cult following there will be an opportunity to sell branded merchandise and Pilates equipment [this is out of MS1 scope currently]._

# Features

From the project goals the following features were included in the scope of the project.

1. Colours were carefully selected and a small pallet of warm complementary colours were used. 
they include:
     
       1. #3f000f
       2. #fafafa
       3. #eb8108
       4. blanchedalmond

Complementary images were sourced from PEXELS.com for the site and these are of movement and stretching linking with with the pilates way.

2. The fonts used are Lora, Imbue and fall back is san - serif.     

3. The "Home page" {index.html}, has a navigation bar and a footer which allows users to click on links to reach other pages such as the "about us" page, the "Classes Page", the "Schedule Page and finally the contact page.
In the main part of the Home page is a welcome message and a button that brings visitors to the schedule page. 
The home pages has some animation when you open it which looks well.
In the footer section there is a "contact us" button which brings the user to the contact page which holds a short from to fill in with their name and phone numbers etc. 
Also in the footer there are working links to the social media pages suchas facebook, twitter etc. On the navigation bar is the logo (link to home page ) and a phone number. We have the companys email and phone number again in the footer.

4. The Navigation bar and the footer bar is uniform across all pages on the site and gives a sense of consistance and familarity no matter which page 
you are on.
 
5. The "About us" {about.html} page introduces the 4 team members and gives a brief account of them and their background. It is styled in 3 columns with information on the outer two 
and a photo of the team is in the middle column.

6. "Classes" {classes.html} page lists the classes available and what's involved in each. Again colours aand images are complementary.

7  A "Schedule" {classtimes.html} page which lists the days, the times and the cost of each class and service. This page includes and inspiring quote from Joseph Pilates And has a warm and eye catching 
image in the background.

8 Finally the "Contact Us" {contact.html} page has a form that the user fills out so that we can email them or phone them back. The form is simple and clear and will insist on you put in the correct information.


>> Future scope will see another page that will list and sell pilates equipment and gear.


## Structure

The site is a series of 5 html pages that can be accessed in the navigation bar and other active links on the home page and footer. 
To make this site responsive I had to use media queries 
and leave out pages such as "Classes" and "Contact us" so that the nav bar would render correctly.
Also I got rid of the telephone number on the top screen for the smaller devices as it also at the bottom of the page. 
For the tiny devices I removed the overlay on the  home page again to help with responsivity.

## Wireframes

[PDF of all wireframes for this project](/assets/wireframes/milestoneproject1.pdf) 


## Skeleton
* The information is displayed in different pages with links in the navigation bar.
* Each section has its own html page.
* The navigation and footer bars are consistant across all pages.
* The footer bar contains social media links and a link to the contact us page.
* The form on the "contact us" page allow users to reach us.

## Surface

The look and feel of the website should be one of warmth, friendliness, fitness,
cleanliness and upmost professionalism. The colour and themes are uniform and complementary 
throughout. Its clear and easy to find what information you need from the website. The images used 
are inclusive and welcoming to all.  


## Technologies Used

The technologies used were 
* HTML5 
* CSS3

## Framework

* Google Fonts: to import the font-family Imbue:wght@300, Lora and Roboto. Didn't use Roboto 
* Font Awesome (v5.6.3). Icons on website.
* Git for version control.
* GitHub is the repository for all projects.
* Befunky to resize and edit photos.
* Balsamiq used to create the wireframes during the design process.
* W3Cschools 
* W3C Validators HTML5 CSS3 (Jigsaw) and Wave Web assessibility evaluation tool.

## Future technology
* Bootstrap and jQuery

  * Plan to add a model about special offer, carousal of pictures of happy pilate people
  * Also add a collapsible nav menu for the smaller devices.

## Testing


* Throughout the writing and styling of the pages I ran Devtools from google crome each and every time in an effort to make sure my website 
was responsive across all devices.

* The code was put through W3C Validators for HTML and CSS3 with no issues found.

* The Wave Web assessibility warned about the colors used and readability thus back ground colour was changed to a darker colour. 
  Also some font colors were switched also.

#### Other users

Feed back from my pilates users and friends and family I asked to test the site was as follows:

* That the site was easy to use.  

* That contact information was to hand and easy to locate no matter which page you were on.

* It was easy to get back to the home page by clicking on the logo at the top of every page. Please try it out :
[Home Page](https://michele-c.github.io/Milestone-project-1/index.html)
* It was easy to find the social media links at the bottom of every page
* It was nice to read about the team members and to see them.
* The Contact Us form was easy to find and clear and simple to fill out. 
* Different type of devices were used and the user found that the site was managable on mobiles & tables also.
* The phone number for the business was clear to see on each page and every device.

One example of testing went as follows:
>Test: To make sure the "Contact Us" form is working correctly. 
>> 1. Log on to the Pilates Parlour website. 
>>2. Click on the Contact Us link on the top right had corner. An orange line should appear when you hover over the words "Contact Us". When you click you should be brought straight away to the Contact us webpage which looks like this 
[Contact Us](https://michele-c.github.io/Milestone-project-1/contact.html)
>>>3 The test that the form is behaving correctly we will type in an incorrect email address - we should get a warning which we do like this image - [Error Message](/assets/img/errormessage.jpg)






## BUGS: 

I found that on the very small screens the images were truncated for example, on screens under 350px. This was fixed by the display: none; style for extra small screens.

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

## Deployment


GitHub Pages was used to deploy this website.


* From your broswer log into GitHub with you login account. 
* Locate the specific project's GitHub Repository. It will be in a list on your left hand side.
* In the repository, click on the Settings tab at the top right hand corner of the middle panel. It 
has a cog wheel beside it.
* After clicking on settings scroll down about halfway where it says GitHub Pages.
* Select "master branch" from the drop-down under Source, then click save. It'll then give a URL, which is the live deployment page to use.
(note it may take a couple minutes and a hard refresh Ctrl+F5 to fully load your project the first time)
* Then go back to the top, click Code tab to go back to the main repository, and at the very top to the very right there's a place to paste the live deployment link. You are live!
* Your readme file will be located under it.

To run the code locally do the following:

When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub to your local machine.

* Log onto github.
* Go to the main page of the repository.
* Over the list of files, click on the word Code.
* We want to clone the repository using HTTPS so click on HTTPS and copy the link provided.
* In your own IDE open GIT bash.
* Change to the directory where you want the clone directory and files to go into.
* In the terminal type in "git clone" and paste in the URL that you just copied form Github.
* Hit enter and you have your local clone.

#### About the business - 
The Pilates Parlour is a new Pilates studio in the south west region of Ireland. Brainchild of inspirational Pilates master instructors, Ursula and Hanna Gluckman. The custom-built studio opened its doors in 2016 in Ennis, Co Clare. 

The studio, in the past, catered for small groups of students but recently has built on three further rooms and hired another instructor. Their methods and classes have delivered amazing results in alleviating backpain and poor posture, while improving flexibility, fitness and overall health. Bodies get transformed. 
Once attended, users return to The Pilates Parlour again and again.

#### Project Goals for the business -
We plan to build an impressive website in order to create a strong online presence and promote the existing “The Pilates Parlour” business in the south west region of Ireland and beyond.
The website will provide the following information in a positive user-focused manner:
*	Use suitable typograph, imagery and color schemes across all pages to provide a positive experience for our users.

*	Tell the background story of The Pilates Parlour, its ethos and the history behind the effective Pilates method used.

*	Provide an insight into the instructors and their qualifications

*	Provide a brief but informative description of the classes and the different levels of fitness and flexibility catered for

*	Provide the class schedules

*	List clearly the cost involved 

*	Explain what one needs to bring with them to the classes and what to expect?

*	Provide location and contact details, including a contact form so that users and send in their details and thus we can contact them directly and sign them up to the most suitable class for them.

*	Ultimately – the site will promote the business and increase sunscribers and revenue.

	

_Once the business has established a cult following there will be an opportunity to sell branded merchandise and Pilates equipment [this is out of MS1 scope currently]._

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
